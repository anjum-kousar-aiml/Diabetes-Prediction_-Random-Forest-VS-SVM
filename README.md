# Diabetes-Prediction_-Random-Forest-VS-SVM
This repository contains a Machine Learning project for predicting Diabetes. It has a comparison of Random Forest and SVM algorithms. Random Forest, known for its robustness and ability to handle large datasets, constructs multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. SVM, effective in high-dimensional spaces, finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes. Random Forest has shown more accuracy in predicting diabetes. The project offers evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess and compare the performance of both models. Required packages: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
